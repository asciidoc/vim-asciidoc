= AsciiDoc syntax support for Vim

This is the development version of Vim's included syntax highlighting and filetype plugins for AsciiDoc.
Generally you don't need to install these if you are running a recent version of Vim.

== Overview

Syntax highlighting is incredibly useful.
In addition to making reading AsciiDoc documents much easier, syntax highlighting also helps you catch AsciiDoc syntax errors as you write your documents.

This repository contains the Vim files necessary to syntax highlight AsciiDoc in Vim.
A stable version of these files is included in the Vim distribution (see https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/syntax/asciidoc.vim[]).

== Folding

Folding on the section level is included as well.
To enable the folding, add

----
let g:asciidoc_folding=1
----

to the `.vimrc` file.

== Installation (development files)

Install the highlighter by copying `asciidoc.vim` to your `$HOME/.vim/syntax` directory.

NOTE: Create this directory if it doesn't already exist.

You can enable syntax highlighing in one of the following ways:

. Put a Vim _autocmd_ in your Vim configuration file
. Execute the Vim command `:set syntax=asciidoc`
. Add the following line to the end of you AsciiDoc source files:

 // vim: set syntax=asciidoc:
